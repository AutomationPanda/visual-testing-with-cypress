# Tutorial: Visual Testing with Cypress

TBD


## Abstract

Visuals are the DNA of good User Interfaces (UI) and User Experience (UX).
Traditional UI-based test automation is great for *interactions* like navigating pages and clicking buttons,
but it struggles with *verifications* that reflect what users actually see.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to improve your test coverage while simplifying your test code with visual testing techniques.
We will use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to automate tests against a Trello-like web app,
and we will incorporate [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) for visual testing.
The tutorial will cover how to add visual assertions to tests,
how to handle test results,
and how to modernize cross-browser testing.


## Agenda

This tutorial has eight parts:

1. Setting up the app under test
2. Automating our first Cypress test
3. Rewriting our test with visual assertions
4. Introducing visual changes
5. Testing different browsers
6. Applying different matching techniques
7. Checking specific elements
8. Learning more independently
